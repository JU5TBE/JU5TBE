<span class="b"> Flow </span>

    Flow is a book that primarily focuses 

    how we can find happiness in our lives.

    The book argues that for there to be happiness

    one must spend their time in flow (which is a state

    of complete involvement and no distractions which    ties to essentiallism)

    <span class="mc">Main Concepts</span>

    <span class="point">

      •Flow is the state in which pleasure 

       is archieved whenyou dissociate with 

       worldly worries and completely focus one the task or moment

    </span>

    

    <span class="point">

      •Archieving a state of flow requires an activity in which

      (1. it has a skill level and its easy to gain feeback on actions

       2. what you are doing is challenging enough to be exciting yet

          not too difficult to be overwhelming)

    </span>

    <span class="point">

      •Regularily archieving this state can provide lifelong 

       happiness and contentment even through normal chores,

       it can also lead to highly productive work as an additional benefit.
