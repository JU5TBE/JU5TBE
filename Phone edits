     NO MORE,MR NICE GUY

     A somewhat mistakenly controversial book about the
     y2k concept of nice guys.It brings to lite the
     common pitfalls (usually orchastrated by the nice
     guy) in their lives and how to fix it.
  
      <span class="mc"> Main concepts </span>

     â€¢Nice guys use niceness (termed in the book as 
      covert contracts) to manipulate people in order
      to get their needs met (not so nice is it)
  </span> 
  
  <span class="p">
  â€¢ bonus(this means that they prioritise their needs
         last and hope that they will be met and 
         overreact when they aren't)

  <span class="p">
      â€¢Nice guys feel as if they can directly ask for
     what they want which oftentimes leds to their 
     needs not met

     â€¢ â€¢Prioritising their needs first (being assertive)is actually an important part towards curing
