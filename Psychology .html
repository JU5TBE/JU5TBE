     MISTAKES WERE MADE,BUT NOT BY ME
    </span>
     This book shines a light in how and why
     (ego...mostly...) we shift or 
     justify mistakes.
  
      <span class="mc"> Main concepts </span>
   
  <span class="point">
     â€¢we rationalize mistakes to maintain our self
     concept/pride/ego(cognitive dissonance)we even use 
     confirmation bias

     Predictably Irrational

     This book and THINKING FAST AND SLOW are almost
     the same thing,They argue we are not naturally

    Noise
    </span>
     This book is also nearly the same as Thinking fast
     and slow but its more about variability (aka noise ).The higher the difference in judgement the
     higher the noise.
  
      <span class="mc"> Main concepts </span>
   
  <span class="point">
     â€¢algorithms on average make better decisions than
      us (is it useful...well,but its the main lesson
      and its still a good read).

     â€¢There is level noise (general differnce in 
     judgement) and pattern noise(difference in judgement in a specific case).

     NO MORE,MR NICE GUY

     A somewhat mistakenly controversial book about the
     y2k concept of nice guys.It brings to lite the
     common pitfalls (usually orchastrated by the nice
     guy) in their lives and how to fix it.
  
      <span class= "mc"> Main concepts </span>
   
  <span class= "point">
     â€¢Nice guys use niceness (termed in the book as 
      covert contracts) to manipulate people in order
      to get their needs met (not so nice is it)
  </span> 
  
  <span class= "point">
  â€¢ bonus(this means that they prioritise their needs
         last and hope that they will be met and 
         overreact when they aren't)
    
  </span> 
     
  <span class= "point">
      â€¢Nice guys feel as if they can directly ask for
     what they want which oftentimes leds to their 
     needs not met
  </span>
  
   <span class= "point">
     â€¢ â€¢Prioritising their needs first (being assertive)is actually an important part towards curing
