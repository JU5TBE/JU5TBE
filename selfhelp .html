     A somewhat mistakenly controversial book about the
     y2k concept of nice guys.It brings to lite the
     common pitfalls (usually orchastrated by the nice

     •Nice guys use niceness (termed in the book as 
      covert contracts) to manipulate people in order
      to get their needs met (not so nice is it)
  </span> 
  
  <span class="p">
  • bonus(this means that they prioritise their needs
         last and hope that they will be met and 
         overreact when they aren't)

      •Nice guys feel as if they can directly ask for
     what they want which oftentimes leds to their 
     needs not met

    THE ART OF SEDUCTION
    
    </span>
    
    This book basically teaches how to create attraction using basic principles designed to take 
    advantage pf our instincts(i might be painting it
    in a bad way,but it being controversial does not
    mean it isn't somewhat accurate)
    
    
    
    

      <span class="mc"> Main concepts </span>
   
  <span class= "point">
     •The most basic idea is that you have to choose
     a "target" that will be receptive (amazing,pick someone thats interested (or gullible...maybe..dont))

  <span class= "point">
     •Create skibidy sigma rizz as the youngins call it.

     In this story narrative book are lessons on ways
     to improve decision making,Authored by a former
     US FIGHTER PILOT and Its concepts are widely
     used by the US Airforce (meaning they are mostly 
     legit (If its good enough for America's Military....))
    

      <span class="mc"> Main concepts </span>
   
  <span class= "point">
     •The most standout idea for me is Fast focasting
      (essentially thinking in probabilities on steroids) frankly he can explain it better (look inside
      the material section ).
       
  </span> 
  
  <span class= "point">
     •The book prioritises creative thinking(moreso on the later parts) and goves a method called "conceptual
     learning" (learn the concepts,not the details) as a way of developing critical thinking.
  </span> 
  
  <span class= "point">
     •it also introduce the concept of power laws
