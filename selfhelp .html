     A somewhat mistakenly controversial book about the

    This book basically teaches how to create attraction using basic principles designed to take

    in a bad way,but it being controversial does not
    mean it isn't somewhat accurate)

     In this story narrative book are lessons on ways

 </span>
The book simplifies the science of habitual behaviour
and give practical advice in creating,maintaining and destroying habitual behavior,its text is easy to read and is easily understandable(if you understant its contents then you will understand the power of habits)
(from here onward i will just which book ties to which book).

<span class="mc">
  Main concepts
</span>

<span class="point">
  •Habits have a cue,routine,reward system
   (the cue is something that triggers the habit
   the routine is the habit,and the reward is what 
   you get out of the habit and also reinforces it)
</span>

<span class="point">
  •In order to create a habit it must have these three
   qualities,in order to destroy it you must 
   atleast remove one of these.
</span>

<span class="point">
  •the more you do a habit the more it is reinforced
